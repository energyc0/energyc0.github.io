# About energyc0

I am Maxim, I am from Russia and I like programming. I am 18 years old and I am first-year student of SPbU. This is my website and here I share everything I know.
I am interested in 3D and low level programming like bare-metal, drivers, compilers, emulators and a lot of other things. I use C, C++ and ASM in my projects.
